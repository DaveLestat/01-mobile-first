**Author**: Ashley Breunich & Dave Cerino

## Overview
The purpose of this application is to create a blog that is built using mobile-first design using responsive web techniques and whose style is organized using Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS. 

## Getting Started
In order to use this program and get it running on your own computer, you will need to go to the [GitHub link](https://github.com/DaveLestat/01-mobile-first/tree/dave-ashley/dave-ashley), fork the repository, and then clone it down to your machine. Make sure you include a [normalize.css stylesheet](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/blob/master/normalize.css) if you do not see one in the repo.

## Architecture
This program utilizes HTML and CSS. The CSS is categorized using the SMACSS method. It also includes an icon style package from [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/).
